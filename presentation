a quick way to
access normal mode command
from insert mode

whoami
- graduated from mathematics department last year
- vim experience:
  - 1.5 years in space-vim by liuchengxu
  - 0.5 year configure my own vim config
- github.com/bruhtus || diawan@pm.me

why?
- convenient
- break the undo sequence easily

how?
- alt or meta key + normal mode command
- ctrl-o insert mode command

alt key + normal mode command

the difference between
alt key + normal mode command
and ctrl-o insert mode command

it's showtime!

the weird alt-a
